			<h2>Take a look at three of our exciting projects this semester</h2>
			<div class="cards">

					<h3>
						Tracking water loss in Rwanda
					</h3>
					<p>
						The team of this exciting project is working for a public water access provider in Rwanda. The challenge is to accurately track the water flow between the different stations to detect potential leaks and understand water availability at different locations. Being experts in Excel, the team has built a comprehensive excel tool that connects to the client's data basis and is consistently updated.

					<h3>
						Road to Europe
					</h3>
					<p>
						In the context of this special project, we are supporting a principal of a high school in Nigeria to pursue her vision to send graduate students to Europe for higher education. The team is preparing a detailed report about various study programs in Europe to provide prospective students with a realistic perspective on the academic opportunities in Europe.
					</p>

				<div class="card">
					<h3>
						Table for Two
					</h3>
					<p>
						This international project is supporting a Japanese NGO to enter the German market. Offering a one-for-one concept, this NGO has set its mission to balance the overweight in developed countries and the underweight in developing countries: By paying a premium for a healthy, balanced meal in a German cafeteria, a corporate employee finances a nutrious meal for a child in Africa. The team is currently analyzing the German market and identifying potential corporates to support the client with its market expansion plans.
